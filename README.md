# Mono Monet Fansite

## Goals

-   Make an awesome birthday present for Mono and Tabemonos
-   Create an authentic GeoCities experience (mostly)
-   Use simple technologies so that it can be hosted on anything

## Design

The design inspiration is [GeoCities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities). You can see some examples here for ideas: <https://geocities.restorativland.org/>

More specific decisions for the design will be made in the V4Mirai official Discord: <https://discord.gg/WY3mKCf3>
